## Key Insights  
**Platform Efficiency Dominates:** TikTok Ads consistently deliver the highest ROAS and lowest CPA across nearly all segments.  

**Scaling ≠ Profitability:** Increased ad spend raises revenue but produces diminishing returns, ROAS declines sharply at higher spend levels.  

**CTR Is a Vanity Metric:** Click-through rate shows no meaningful correlation with ROAS and should not drive optimization decisions.  

**Campaign Type Parity:** Search, Video, Display, and Shopping formats perform similarly, suggesting format choice should follow campaign goals, not efficiency expectations.  

**Geography & Seasonality Matter at the Margin:** Germany and India show stronger ROAS, while Winter slightly outperforms other seasons in return efficiency.  

**Low-Spend Wins:** The highest ROAS occurs in low spend buckets (≤ $2K), particularly on TikTok during Spring and Winter.

## Final Recommendation  
A $100K budget should prioritize **TikTok Ads at low spend levels**, with smaller allocations to Meta for diversification and limited Google spend for coverage. This strategy maximizes return while avoiding diminishing returns from over-scaling.
